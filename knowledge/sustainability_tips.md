# Sustainability Guide for Green Bharat

## Individual Actions for Cleaner Air

### Transportation
- **Use public transport**: Reduces per-person emissions by 45% compared to driving alone
- **Carpool**: Sharing rides cuts emissions proportionally. Apps like QuickRide and sRide help in Indian cities
- **Switch to EVs**: Electric two-wheelers (Ather, Ola Electric) save ₹40,000/year in fuel costs
- **Cycle for short distances**: 30% of urban trips in India are under 2 km — perfect for cycling
- **Work from home**: Even 2 days/week reduces transportation emissions by 40%

### Household Energy
- **Switch to LED bulbs**: Use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs
- **Solar water heaters**: Save ₹2,000–4,000/year. Government subsidies available under PM-KUSUM
- **Use 5-star rated appliances**: ACs and refrigerators with 5-star BEE rating consume 30% less power
- **Rooftop solar panels**: Government provides 40% subsidy for 1–3 kW systems under PM Surya Ghar
- **Smart power strips**: Eliminate phantom loads that waste 5–10% of household electricity

### Cooking
- **Use induction/electric cooking**: Zero indoor air pollution compared to LPG/biomass
- **Improved biomass cookstoves**: Reduce particulate emissions by 60% in rural areas
- **Pressure cookers**: Save 70% energy compared to open-pot cooking
- **Cover pots while cooking**: Reduces energy consumption by 25%

### Waste Management
- **Segregate waste**: Wet and dry waste separation enables 80% recyclability
- **Compost kitchen waste**: Reduces methane from landfills; produces free fertilizer
- **Avoid single-use plastic**: India banned single-use plastic items in 2022
- **E-waste recycling**: Drop off at authorized collection centers (list on CPCB website)

## Community & City-Level Actions

### Urban Greening
- **Plant native trees**: Neem, Peepal, and Banyan trees are excellent air purifiers
- **Vertical gardens on buildings**: Reduce building temperature by 3–5°C
- **Urban forests (Miyawaki method)**: 30x denser than conventional plantations; cities like Chennai and Bangalore have adopted this
- **Green corridors along highways**: Reduce roadside PM levels by 20–30%

### Clean Energy Transition
- **India's target**: 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030
- **Current renewable capacity**: ~180 GW (solar + wind)
- **Community solar projects**: Apartment complexes can install shared solar systems
- **Green hydrogen**: India aims to produce 5 million tonnes by 2030

### Water Conservation
- **Rainwater harvesting**: Mandatory in many Indian states; saves ₹50,000/year for a typical household
- **Drip irrigation**: Saves 30–60% water compared to flood irrigation
- **Grey water recycling**: Reuse kitchen/bathroom water for gardens
- **Fix leaks promptly**: A dripping tap wastes 15,000 litres/year

## Government Initiatives for Green Bharat

### National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
- Target: 40% reduction in PM2.5/PM10 by 2026 in 131 cities
- Budget: ₹10,566 crore allocated
- Focus: vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, road dust, construction

### Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0
- Focus on waste management, ODF+ (Open Defecation Free Plus)
- Liquid waste management in all cities

### FAME II (Faster Adoption of Electric Vehicles)
- ₹10,000 crore scheme to promote EVs
- Subsidies: ₹15,000/kWh for electric two-wheelers; ₹20,000/kWh for e-buses

### PM Surya Ghar (Rooftop Solar)
- Free electricity up to 300 units/month
- 40% subsidy for systems up to 3 kW
- Target: 1 crore households by 2027
