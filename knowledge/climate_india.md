# Climate and Environmental Context — India

## India's Climate Challenge

India is the world's 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gases but has one of the lowest per-capita emissions (1.9 tonnes CO₂ vs global average of 4.7 tonnes). With 1.4 billion people, even small per-capita increases have massive absolute impact.

### Key Climate Risks for India
- **Heat waves**: Frequency increased 30x since 1980. 2024 saw temperatures exceeding 50°C in Rajasthan
- **Monsoon disruption**: More intense but shorter monsoon seasons. Extreme rainfall events up by 75%
- **Sea level rise**: 1.3 mm/year threatening Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata coastlines
- **Glacial melt**: Himalayan glaciers retreating at 10–15 meters/year, threatening water supply for 500 million people
- **Agricultural impact**: Crop yields projected to drop 10–25% by 2050 without adaptation

## Air Pollution in India — The Crisis

### Scale of the Problem
- Air pollution causes an estimated 1.67 million premature deaths annually in India
- 21 of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India
- Economic cost: ~$150 billion/year (5.4% of GDP) from health impacts and lost productivity
- Average life expectancy reduced by 5.3 years due to air pollution

### Major Sources of Air Pollution in Indian Cities
1. **Vehicular emissions** (30–40%): 300+ million vehicles on Indian roads
2. **Industrial emissions** (20–30%): Power plants, brick kilns, manufacturing
3. **Construction dust** (10–15%): Rapid urbanization with inadequate dust control
4. **Biomass/crop burning** (10–25%, seasonal): 35 million tonnes of crop residue burned annually in Punjab and Haryana
5. **Domestic cooking** (5–10%): 600 million people still use solid fuels
6. **Waste burning** (5–10%): Open burning of municipal waste in many cities

### Delhi's Air Quality Crisis
- Winter AQI regularly exceeds 400-500 (Severe category)
- Major factors: geographic bowl trapping pollutants, stubble burning, low wind speeds
- Government responses: Odd-even vehicle scheme, GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan), ban on firecrackers
- GRAP Stages:
  - Stage I (AQI 201-300): Ban on coal/firewood in restaurants
  - Stage II (AQI 301-400): Ban on diesel generators
  - Stage III (AQI 401-450): Ban on construction activities
  - Stage IV (AQI >450): Ban on truck entry, 50% office WFH

## India's Green Commitments

### Net Zero by 2070
India committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 at COP26 (Glasgow, 2021).

### Panchamrit Targets (by 2030):
1. Non-fossil fuel energy capacity of 500 GW
2. 50% of energy from renewable sources
3. Reduce total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes
4. Reduce carbon intensity of economy by 45%
5. Achieve net-zero by 2070

### International Solar Alliance (ISA)
- Co-founded by India and France in 2015
- 120+ member countries
- Goal: Mobilize $1 trillion for solar energy by 2030

### National Hydrogen Mission
- Target: 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030
- ₹19,744 crore allocated for SIGHT (Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition)

## Environmental Monitoring in India

### CPCB Monitoring Network
- Central Pollution Control Board operates 900+ monitoring stations across India
- Real-time data available at app.cpcbccr.com
- Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) measure PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3

### SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting)
- Operated by IITM, Pune under Ministry of Earth Sciences
- Provides 1–3 day air quality forecasts for Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, and Ahmedabad
- Health advisories and emission scenario analysis

### State Pollution Control Boards
- Each state has a Pollution Control Board (SPCB) responsible for monitoring and enforcement
- Industrial consent management and compliance monitoring
